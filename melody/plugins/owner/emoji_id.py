"""
🆔 /emojiid — Owner-only utility to extract REAL Telegram premium
animated custom-emoji ids.

WHY THIS EXISTS
----------------
"Premium animated emoji" only render when an <emoji id="..."> entity
points at a real Telegram custom-emoji document. A previous change broke
this (and took the surrounding <blockquote> "quote" down with it) by
hand-typing plausible-looking ids that were never real — see
utils/telegram_html.py and utils/formatters.py for the fix that makes bad
ids fail safe.

But failing safe just means the emoji quietly doesn't show up — to
actually get the animated emoji to appear, this bot needs *real* custom
emoji ids. The only legitimate source for those is Telegram itself: every
message that contains a premium animated emoji carries its real document
id in that message's entities.

USAGE
-----
Reply to any message containing one or more premium animated emoji with
/emojiid. The bot reads the real ids straight from Telegram's own message
entities (no guessing), double-checks each one is still resolvable via
get_custom_emoji_stickers, and returns copy-pastable
premium_emoji("<id>", "<glyph>") snippets for the ones that are.
